# CarbonHub Emission Tracker
## What is CarbonHub?
CarbonHub is a responsive full-stack web application that enables teams and organisations to record and analyse their travel related carbon emissions. 

New features are actively being developed and introduced to the application, but a demo version with initial functionality can be accessed at this URL: https://damp-cove-97875.herokuapp.com/

## Technology Stack
The app is built with the **MERN** stack, utilising **React** on the front-end, **Redux** for state management, **Express.js** and **Node.js** for the server and **MongoDB** for the database. 

The app is hosted on **Heroku** and setup for deployment using **Git** and the **Heroku CLI**. 

In addition to the core stack, the app makes use of **Reactstrap** components, **JSON Web Tokens** for user authentication and **bcrypt.js** for password hashing.
